# Google Docs Table of Contents Links Fixer

A Google Apps Script that automatically fixes or removes broken Table of Contents links in Google Docs. It scans all headings, inserts bookmarks, and updates in-document links to point correctly to those bookmarks.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Iterates through all paragraphs in the document body and identifies those styled as headings (Heading 1–6).
    
2. Inserts a unique bookmark at the start of each heading.
    
3. Searches every text element for links containing `#heading=` patterns (including `?tab=t.0#heading=`).
    
4. Matches each link’s display text against the collected heading texts (exact or partial match).
    
5. Replaces the old link URL with a new bookmark URL (`#bookmark=<ID>`).
    
6. Logs each correction. Use the additional `removeBrokenLinks` function to delete any unresolved links.
    

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open your Google Doc.
    
2. Go to **Extensions → Apps Script**.
    
3. Remove existing template code.
    
4. Copy and paste the entire script into the editor.
    
5. Save the project as **Google Docs Table of Contents Links Fixer**.
    
6. Select and run the `fixTableOfContentsLinks` function.
    
7. Authorize when prompted.
    
8. 🗑️ Optionally, run `removeBrokenLinks` to clean up any remaining broken links.
    

## 📋 Requirements

## ⚠️ Limitations
